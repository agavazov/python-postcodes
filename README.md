# My first python code

## Requirements
- Get longitude and latitude for a list of postcodes in UK from http://postcodes.io/
- Sort them from north to south
- Find those which are in specific radius
- Make unit tests

## Extra things from me
- add .travis.yml
- use flask
- provide graphical maps
- add Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml
